# Computer Vision
Here i'll store my jupyter notebooks in computer vision as i follow my studies. I'll use basically two main approaches

### 1 - Using classical techniques
Those notebooks will be produced using as reference the Jan Erik Solem's book 'Programming COmputer Vision with Python' by O'Reilly.
My first idea is to make one or two notebooks for each book's chapter

### 2 - Using deep learning
In these notebooks i'll use deep learning with keras (or tensorflow) to make image classification or segmentation


As i post notebooks here i'll update this readme
